\FINAL-MERGED: 	Contains the final Latex/PDF file, the algorithms we used and the plot files
	\Jacobi_method: 				Contains the Jacobi algorthm for one electron
	\Jacobi_2El_in_harm_ossc_: 			Contains the Jacobi algorithm for two electrons
	\Jacobi_method_matrixsize_against_iterations: 	Evaluates the number of interations that are needed for a nxn matrix with the Jacobi algorithm
	\Rho_max_against_Ev_2El:			Creates a textdocument which shows the first Eigenvalue for the two electron problem against rho_max(or n, if the code is changes a little)
	\Householder_algorithm_1el:			Contains the Householders algorithm for our problem with one electron
	\2El_in_harm_ossc_r_function:			Contains the Jacobi algorithm for two electrons. In this program we are calculate with units.
